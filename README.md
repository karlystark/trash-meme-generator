# trash-meme-generator
a meme generator created for rithm prework

In this prework project, I created a trash animal themed meme generator that takes a user-inputted image url, top text, and bottom text, and creates a meme using these assets.
The meme generator displays created memes in a flexbox display container, and a delete button is included to allow users to delete memes from the meme collection display.

This is my first project exploring DOM manipulation, and it was challenging and fun to break the problem down into smaller pieces and approach each one. The most challenging
part was juggling/naming all of the variables and classes, given that there are only a few element types (avoiding repetition was hard!). It also took a bit to figure out the 
CSS layout (again, this seems to be early-days challenging). 

Some features I would like to add are:
1. Allowing user to download memes
2. Allowing user an option to include centered text (some meme templates require text to be centered) (done!)
